# Functions for numerical analogy
This document provides functions for computing analogical powers.

**Definition:**
An analogy in $`p`$ holds between four numbers when
the generalized mean in $`p`$ of the extremes
is equal to
the generalized mean in $`p`$ of the means.
```math
m_p(a, d) = m_p(b, c)
```
where
```math
m_p(a, d) = \left( \dfrac{1}{2} (a^p + d^p) \right)^{1/p}.
```

**Library purpose:**
The present library computes the analogical powers of a given quadruple of non-null numbers, $`(a, b, c, d)`$.
